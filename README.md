# GenesysGo Premium RPC Authentication Node.js Example

This is a barebones example implementation of authenticating your GenesysGo Premium RPC requests.

⚠️ This setup is not recommended for production ⚠️

It is highly recommended that you place a proxy in front of your authenticated RPC calls so you do not expose your auth tokens to the world. Exposing your auth token may lead to your RPC being used by others for free.
