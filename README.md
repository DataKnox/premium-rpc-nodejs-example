# GenesysGo Premium RPC Authentication Node.js Example

In this repository, you will find two different options for deploying a proxy for your Premium RPC. This proxy's purpose is to handle recycling your JWT token every 5 minutes, and adding it to any of your requests before sending it on to your RPC endpoint.

You can deploy this on the same machine as your dApp using the localhost implementation, or you can deploy it on a completely separate machine using the ssl option. 

Guides for each can be found within.
